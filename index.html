            I saw him in first UCH Christian Fellowship, he was fervent, loves God and committed to nurturing God's people. We were in the same unit then, Drama Unit and I also got to know he's a senior colleague and that was all to it, a brethren 🥹. A year later God decided it's time for a love story written about us to come into physical manifestation, he proposed and I said no, a serious one😅 but he recieved it in good fate and returned to God who had convinced him, but mercy said no🙂‍↔️, I knew this not because he told me he's been actively praying despite the no but for the drastic transformation and convictions God gave me even when he's stopped chasing actively. After all said and done, I said **YES** and it's been a very ecstatic experience all the way, beyond spiritual conviction, He has proven to be a man for me in words and every action and I'm grateful to God for this.

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            The story of how I met Eunice is one that could only have been by supernatural orchestration. It was on a _Twosday, you know- a day meant for two people in love 🤣_. The drama unit of my school fellowship (Calvary Love Theatre) was to have a drama rehearsal that evening. I met Eunice already on the field- or was she the one who met me there? Can't remember the details now. But what stood out that day was that Eunice and I were the only people who came for that meeting. What was then supposed to be a drama rehearsal turned out to be the beginning of a talking stage🤣. I've been seeing her in the fellowship, UCHCF, before then, but that was the first time I would see her upclose. We spoke about Ogbomosho where her parents lived, I was really captured by her deep Yoruba accent sprinkled with Ogbomosho dialect- Kai! If you know, you know.
            <br><br>
            We also spoke about school activities, upcoming tests and the needed preparations. I initially had no intention, I was only trying to be a good senior colleague, telling her about past questions, ways to answer them, etc.
            But after we departed that day, I thought within my mind, this lady is not bad oo🥹. She might be the perfect person for me. But then, my head countered and I was like, oh boy! she is not your type jor.
            <br><br>
            Days ran into weeks and then months. I couldn't get Eunice out of my thought. She had one profile picture on her WhatsApp then, anytime I saw it, it gave me hormonal surge. Adrenaline up, dopamine up, Testosterone up... I will stare at that picture for hours, analysing her smile, her lips, her teeth, everything just looked perfecto.
            <br><br>
            She then celebrated her birthday and I posted that picture on my status to celebrate her. As if confirming my thoughts, a friend of mine entered my dm and said 'this lady has such a beautiful smile, is she our sister?'
            'May be' I smiled in agreement.
            After that time, Eunice became more than just any sister but my sister. I was always watching out for her in church services. I would go ask her friend when I didn't see her, after all, I was in counselling and follow up unit, I was just doing my job🤣🤣.
            <br><br>
            Many things happened afterwards. Like praying to God and getting my convictions to propose to her just for this sister to come back in a month's time to say "the Holy spirit is not leading her in my direction".
            Everything first blur🥹🥹. Which Holy Spirit? I sha went to my room to cry🤣, told some few people who encouraged me and I raised a prayer altar on her behalf. I would go around UCH every night and declare "Eunice, the lord will open your eyes, the lord will touch your heart, Eu is mine🥹"
            <br><br>
            Men and brethren, God taught me something through that experience. GOD DOES NOT LIE. His words are anchors, you can hold on to them even when circumstances says otherwise. His words are sure, you can bank on them.
            Today, I am the happiest man in the world because I got a treasure from God whose price is FAR ABOVE RUBIES, something more than gold.
